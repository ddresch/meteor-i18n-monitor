# i18n-monitor

This is a little helper app which connects to a google spreadsheet and generates JSON or JS files for translation keys.

At the moment there is only the console based version of the app working, which depends on settings.json file as configuration. A simple GUI is work in progress :)

2. setup your google project and `private/google-key.pem` file following these [steps](https://github.com/ongoworks/meteor-google-spreadsheets#package-setup)
3. setup your `settings.json` file
4. run `i18n-monitor` to poll spreadsheet
